# Code of conduct

This repository is part of the [PHP.earth](https://github.com/php-earth) organization.

We make our best efforts to guarantee a safe, inclusive and harassment-free
environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

The latest and full version of the code of conduct is available on the
[PHP.earth website](https://php.earth/conduct).

The project team maintains confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. In case of code of conduct violations, contact us at `conduct AT php.earth`.
